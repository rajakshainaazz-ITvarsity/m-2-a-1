                    <h3>LION</h3>
                    <p>The lion is one of the five big cats in the genus 
                        Panthera and a member of the family Felidae. With 
                        some males exceeding 250 kg (550 lb) in weight, it 
                        is the second-largest living cat after the tiger. 
                        Wild lions currently exist in sub-Saharan Africa 
                        and in Asia while other types of lions have disappeared 
                        from North Africa and Southwest Asia in historic times.</p>
                    <p>Lions are at the top of the food chain, with no natural 
                        predators. They are often depicted in stories and films 
                        as majestic and strong. Simba, the Swahili word for lion, 
                        means “king,” “strong,” and “aggressive.” Similarly, in 
                        English, to describe someone as “lionhearted” means that 
                        they are courageous and brave.</p>                        
                    <p>Lions are carnivores. They are apex predators, meaning 
                        that they are at the top of the food chain with no 
                        natural predators. They hunt animals in their surrounding 
                        habitat, which typically includes antelopes and other hoofed 
                        animals. They may also hunt elephants, rhinos, rodents, 
                        reptiles, insects and even crocodiles. They also scavenge 
                        or steal prey from leopards, cheetahs, hyenas, or wild 
                        dogs.</p>
