                    <h3>GIRAFFE</h3>
                    <p>Giraffe (Giraffa camelopardalis): The giraffe is an 
                        African mammal and is the tallest living land animal.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are the tallest land animals. Female giraffes 
                        are up to 14 feet tall and weigh up to 1,500 pounds. 
                        Meanwhile, males are up to 18 feet tall and can weigh 
                        3,000 pounds. At this height, a giraffe can look into 
                        a second-story window. Giraffes are known for their 
                        long, tall appearance. They have a small hump on their 
                        back like a camel and have a spotted pattern similar to 
                        that of a leopard. Because of the combination of these 
                        features, some people called the giraffe a 
                        “camel-leopard.” That's where the giraffe's species 
                        name “camelopardalis” comes from.</p>
                    <p>Giraffes are herbivores, feasting on hundreds of pounds 
                        of leaves a week and traveling miles in search of food. 
                        Their height gives them an advantage over other African 
                        herbivores, as they can reach the high branches for young 
                        leaves. Their 18-inch tongue helps them reach some of the 
                        tougher leaves. It takes a lot to fuel such a large mammal, 
                        and a giraffe may eat up to 75 pounds of food per day. A 
                        giraffe will spend most of its day eating. Giraffes only 
                        need to drink once every several days because they get 
                        most of their water from the luscious plants they eat.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>The giraffes are found at GI11, behind the monkey cage</p>
