                    <h3>TIGER</h3>
                    <p>Tiger (Panthera tigris): The tiger is the largest of all 
                        the Asian big cats and is a member of the genus Panthera.</p>
                    <p>There are two recognized subspecies of tiger: the continental 
                        (Panthera tigris tigris) and the Sunda (Panthera tigris sondaica), 
                        according to IUCN.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are the largest of all the Asian big cats. Tigers range 
                        from six to ten feet long, and they can weigh anywhere from 220 
                        to 660 pounds.</p>
                    <p>Tigers are known for their dark vertical stripes on orange-brown 
                        fur with a lighter underside. Their coloring and marking depend 
                        on the subspecies and the tiger's location. While many of the 
                        large continental tigers have pale orange fur with few stripes, 
                        the smaller Sunda tigers have dark, thickly striped fur.</p>
