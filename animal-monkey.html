                    <h3>MONKEY</h3>
                    <p>A monkey is a primate of the Haplorrhini suborder 
                        and simian infraorder, either an Old World monkey 
                        or a New World monkey, but excluding apes and humans. 
                        Many species are arboreal, although there are species 
                        that live primarily on the ground, such as baboons. 
                        Monkeys are generally considered to be intelligent.</p>
                    <p>We all know the expression monkey see, monkey do. But 
                        should the saying really go monkey hear, monkey do? 
                        Recent studies are finding that the language abilities 
                        of some monkeys are more sophisticated than previously 
                        believed. Much more sophisticated.</p>
                    <p>Monkeys live together in social groups. All members 
                        contribute by helping to defend food sources, raise 
                        young, and watch for predators. But it is impossible 
                        to live in a social group without some form of communication. 
                        Group members need ways to influence and inform each other. 
                        This is what drives language. Monkeys have evolved many ways 
                        of communicating, including visual cues, auditory calls, and 
                        even some olfactory signals. Some of their visual signals are 
                        quite beautiful, like the long, curled tongue of the emperor 
                        tamarin, signaling to her mate when she wants to offload her 
                        babies. But visual signals only work if they can be seen. In 
                        the dense forest and underbrush that most primates live in, 
                        auditory cues are a much more powerful tool. Calls and 
                        vocalizations can also be modified in pitch, loudness, and 
                        duration, which means a vast array of messages can be 
                        transmitted. Alarm calls, territorial calls, food calls, 
                        personal identification calls, dominance calls â€” these are 
                        the basic messages that primates need to successfully live 
                        in groups. But some developed more complex and specialized 
                        forms of auditory communication. Some developed 
                        language.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>Monkeys can be found in cage MO5 or adjacent to the monkey trail</p>
