                    <h3>GEMSBOK</h3>
                    <p>The Gemsbok (Oryx gazella) is the common name given 
                        to the largest and most well known of the 3 species 
                        of Oryx. Due to their horns being so lethal, Gemsbok 
                        have also been called the 'Sabre Antelope'. Its name 
                        is actually derived from the German word for a male 
                        chamois, although they are not related. Gemsbok are 
                        distributed around deserts, scrublands and brushlands 
                        in South Western Africa.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks stand around 4 feet 7 inches at shoulder height 
                        and weigh between 230 - 250 kilograms (females weigh 
                        slightly less than males at around 200 - 210 kilograms). 
                        Gemsboks coats are a light brown/grey colour with lighter 
                        patches to the bottom rear of their rump, and sandy grey 
                        flanks. A dark stripe extends from their chin and travels 
                        down to the bottom of their neck, over their shoulder joints 
                        and leg along their lower flanks and on each side of their 
                        rear legs. All four legs are black on their top half, with 
                        white below the knees and black patches on the shins. 
                        Gemsbok are able to survive in even the harshest 
                        conditions thanks to an intricate network of blood 
                        vessels called carotid rete, situated in the nose which 
                        cool down the blood supplied to the brain. This happens 
                        because of the rapid inflow and outflow of air created by the 
                        gemsboks panting and therefore protects the gemsbok from 
                        deadly temperatures. At the same time, however, the gemsboks 
                        body temperature is allowed to rise - eliminating the need to 
                        perspire (sweat), and therefore preserving water.</p>
                    <p>Gemsboks are herbivores and grazers and consume mainly 
                        tough dry grasses, supplemented with foliage. Gemsboks 
                        are dry-region roughage eaters, with a great capacity 
                        to digest fibre. Desert dwelling gemsbok do not rely on 
                        water to satisfy their thirst, instead they obtain moisture 
                        from tsama melons and by digging up tubers, roots and 
                        eating plant bulbs. Grassland gemsbok have plentiful 
                        water in their habitat that is readily available.</p>
