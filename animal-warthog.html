                    <h3>WARTHOG</h3>
                    <p>Warthogs, as one might guess from the name, are 
                        members of the Swine family and are related to 
                        pigs, boars and hogs. And as the name also suggests, 
                        warthogs have patches on their faces that look like 
                        warts, but are just thick growths of skin. These patches 
                        act as padding for when males fight during mating season.</p>
                    <p>Like their relatives, warthogs are plump, hooved animals 
                        with large nostrils at the end of the snout. They have little 
                        fur, except for a mane that goes down the spine to the middle 
                        of the back, according to the Animal Diversity Web (ADW). 
                        Their tails also end with a tuft of hair.</p>
                    <p>They have large teeth or tusks. Common warthogs have 
                        two upper and four to six lower incisors, according to 
                        ADW, while desert warthogs lack incisors. The upper tusks 
                        grow up to 10 or 11 inches (25 to 30 centimeters) long, 
                        according to the San Diego Zoo.</p>
                    <strong><p>WHERE WILL YOU FIND THEM</p></strong>
                    <p>Warthogs are found at WA8, next to the elephants</p>
