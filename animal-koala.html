                    <h3>KOALA</h3>
                    <p>Koalas average 27-36 in (70 to 90cm) 
                        in length and weigh anywhere from 9 to 20 lbs (4-9 kg). 
                        Females tend to be both slightly smaller and slightly 
                        less heavy than males.  Southern koalas are approximately 
                        30% larger than their northern counterparts. This size 
                        difference is most likely an adaptation to deal with 
                        colder climates in the south.</p>>
                    <p>Although commonly referred to as bears, 
                        koalas are actually marsupialsâ€”an infraclass of mammals 
                        most commonly known for their pouches. Immediately after 
                        birth, underdeveloped newborns migrate to these pouches, 
                        or marsupiums, where they will continue to feed and grow 
                        for the next several months. Many marsupials have pouches 
                        that open upward, toward their heads, but the koala's pouch 
                        opens out toward their hind legs.</p>
                    <p>Koalas are folivores (leaf eaters) and subsist primarily 
                        on eucalyptus leaves, though they will occasionally eat 
                        non-eucalypt plant species. They eat approximately a pound 
                        of leaves daily and rarely drink, obtaining water from its 
                        leafy diet. Though there are well over 600 species of eucalypt, 
                        koalas will often eat from only a handful of eucalypt species, 
                        often specific to the region. Eucalyptus leaves are highly toxic 
                        to most mammals, but koalas have digestive systems specially 
                        adapted to detoxify the poisonous chemicals in the leaves. They 
                        are the only known mammals other than the Greater Glider and 
                        Ringtail Possum that live on a eucalypt diet.  Due to the high 
                        energy expenditure required to digest their food, which is high 
                        in fiber, low in nutrition, and also toxic to most animals and the 
                        species low metabolic rate, koalas spend anywhere from 18 to 20 
                        hours of their day sleeping. Koalas are nocturnal and do the vast 
                        majority of their eating at night.</p>
